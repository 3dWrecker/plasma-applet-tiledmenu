# Tiled Menu

A menu based on Windows 10's Start Menu.

* Supports:
    * Pin/Favourite apps/files through the context menu (or by dragging them from dolphin).
    * Resizing (permanently) the size of the menu with Alt+Clicking and dragging.
    * Panel Icon scales to a maximum of 60px width/height so it can be used on thick panels without scaling too big.
* Does not support (KDE):
    * Draging and dropping apps in the A-Z/Search list to the desktop/panel.
    * Pin to taskbar
    * Recent Documents / Contacts
    * Context Menu Actions (like opening sublime's recent documents)
* Does not support (Win10):
    * Video/Pictures/etc directory shortcuts above the power button (but you can add them to the favourite grid).
    * Most used Apps (kicker's api only supports most recent)
    * Small/Wide/Large sized tiles. 
    * Spaces between tiles (it's a simple list for now).
