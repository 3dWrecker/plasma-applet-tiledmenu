* Configurable sidebar color (because black isn't always best).
* Configurable panel icon.
* The search box can now be configured to follow the desktop theme (still default to white though).
* Refactor the search results and app list to resuse the same code.
* Ability to drag files/launchers from dolphin to the favourites grid.
* Hovering the panel icon while dragging opens the menu.
